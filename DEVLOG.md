# Tribe Command Center — Dev Log

> **Hackathon:** EVE Frontier × Sui Hackathon 2026  
> **Deadline:** March 31, 2026 (submission) → April 1–8 (live deploy to Stillness)  
> **Live URL:** Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploy from `master` branch)  
> **Repo:** github.com/Paarthpowa/tribe-command-center

## Session 1 — MVP Foundation

### What was done
- Scaffolded React 19 + Vite 8 + TypeScript project
- Added Radix UI theme (dark, purple accent) + Tailwind CSS v4
- Implemented core pages: Dashboard, Goal Detail, Create Goal, Members, Leaderboard
- Created Zustand store with `persist` middleware (localStorage)
- Built mock data: tribe, 5 members, 3 goals with tasks/contributions/timelines
- Goal/task system: create goals, pledge resources, track deliveries
- Member management: approve/reject pending members, clearance levels
- Login flow: mock wallet connect, member status gating
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages with SPA `_redirects` rule
- Integrated `@evefrontier/dapp-kit`, `@mysten/dapp-kit-react`, `@mysten/sui` as dependencies (not yet wired up)

### Technical decisions
- **Zustand over Redux** — simpler API, built-in persist, good enough for MVP
- **Radix UI + Tailwind** — accessible primitives + utility classes
- **Mock wallet** — `setWallet('0xalpha_leader_address')` triggers login; real connect later
- **Classification system** — goals can be `normal | classified | top-secret`, visible based on member clearance

## Session 2 — Territory Intel & Star Map

### What was done
- Created **Intel Page** with territory management (claim/unclaim solar systems)
- Built **SystemPicker** — searchable dropdown over 4,800+ real world systems
- Pre-fetched world systems via `scripts/fetch-systems.ts` → saved as `systems-bundle.json` (static, no API call at runtime)
- Built custom **StarMap** component — HTML5 Canvas renderer with:
  - Zoom/pan (mouse wheel + drag)
  - Real system positions (normalized 0–1000 coordinate space)
  - Color-coded by category (core/frontline/contested/expansion/resource/hostile)
  - Click-to-select with hover tooltips
  - HQ marker, claimed system highlighting
- Created **SystemDetailPanel** — slide-in right panel (~700 lines) with:
  - System header: name, ID, category picker, threat level slider
  - Quick actions: Set HQ, Add Base, Scout Report, Unclaim
  - Lagrange Points section (L1–L5 grid with status picker)
  - Bases list (friendly + enemy)
  - Scouting Logs with add form
  - Resources & Dangers
  - Notes editor (per-system free text)

### Technical decisions
- **Canvas over SVG/DOM** — required for 4800+ systems without lag; SVG choked at ~500
- **Static JSON bundle** — world systems don't change often; avoids API dependency at runtime
- **L-points as grid** — L1–L5 displayed as clickable cards; each gets status: unknown/empty/friendly/enemy/contested/resource

---

## Session 3 — Game Research & Data Accuracy

### What was done
- Deep research into EVE Frontier game files:
  - Explored `E:\EVE Frontier` game installation (Stillness server)
  - Analyzed `mapObjects.db` (SQLite) — 324,883 celestial objects across 24,026 solar systems
  - Extracted code from `code.ccp` (111MB ZIP of 10,454 `.pyc` files)
  - Found Smart Assembly types: Network Node, Smart Gate, Smart Storage Unit, Smart Turret
  - Extracted fuel/energy constants, type IDs, group IDs
- **Resource taxonomy overhaul** — replaced placeholder resources with real EVE Frontier resources from wiki:
  - Ores: Veldspar, Scordite, Pyroxeres, Kernite, Omber, Jaspet, Hemorphite, Dark Ochre, Arkonor, Bistot, Crokite, Mercoxit, Spodumain, Gneiss
  - Minerals: Tritanium, Pyerite, Mexallon, Isogen, Nocxium, Zydrine, Megacyte, Morphite
  - Components (fuel, assemblies, ammo, etc.)
- Analyzed `world-contracts` GitHub repo — documented package IDs, 3-layer architecture, tribe info

### Key findings
- **Solar system hierarchy:** Star → Planets → Moons, plus Stargates
- **Character** has `tribe_id: u32` field on-chain — but no tribe management contracts exist
- **No on-chain governance/voting/quests** — our app fills that gap (good for hackathon pitch)
- FSD binary data format is proprietary (CCP's custom format, not easily readable)

## Session 4 — L-Point vs Orbital Zone Clarification

### What was done
- Initially confused **Lagrange Points** and **Orbital Zones** as the same concept
- Researched official docs — concluded (incorrectly) that orbital zones don't exist
- Renamed `OrbitalZone` → `LagrangePoint` throughout codebase
- **User corrected us:** Orbital Zones ARE real — they're a NEW feature from the latest game cycle

### Key clarification
| Concept | What it is | In our app |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Lagrange Point** | Physical anchor location (L1–L5) where Network Nodes/bases are placed | ✅ Implemented as L-point grid in SystemDetailPanel |
| **Orbital Zone** | Content area in space (mining, combat, loot) — replaced old POI system | ❌ Not yet implemented — awaiting type list from user |

### Technical changes
- `OrbitalZone` interface → renamed to `LagrangePoint`
- `orbitalZones` field → renamed to `lagrangePoints` on `TribeSystem`
- `updateOrbitalZone` store action → renamed to `updateLagrangePoint`
- Zustand persist version bumped from 3 → 4 (migration clears old data)

---

## Session 5 — Game File Deep Dive for Orbital Zones

### What was done
- Searched `code.ccp` extensively for orbital zone type definitions
- Found `frontier/crdata/common/objects/cr_orbital.pyc` — CROrbital (base class for stations/starbases, NOT orbital zones)
- Found `frontier/crdata/common/objects/cr_dungeon.pyc` — dungeons with archetypeID/signatureRadius
- Checked protobuf definitions: `combat_site_pb2`, `exploration_scanresult_pb2`, `content_pb2`
- Checked scanner/map filter modules
- **Conclusion:** Orbital zone types are **server-driven data** — not hardcoded in client code
- Awaiting user's manual list of orbital zone types

---

## Session 6 — Cloudflare Deploy & Planning

### What was done
- Verified build is clean (`tsc -b && vite build` — 0 errors)
- Committed all changes (17 files, +2224 / -363 lines)
- Pushed to GitHub → Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy triggered
- Created comprehensive project plan (see below)

└── theme/tokens.css         — CSS custom properties
```

### Data Flow
```
systems-bundle.json (static)
        ↓
  appStore.ts (Zustand)
    ├── worldSystems[] — all 4800+ systems (not persisted)
    ├── systems[] — claimed tribe systems (persisted)
    ├── members[] — tribe members (persisted)
    └── goals[] — goals + tasks + contributions (persisted)
        ↓
  Components read via useAppStore() hooks
```

### Persist Strategy
- **Persisted** (localStorage): `walletAddress`, `isConnected`, `systems`, `members`, `goals`
- **Not persisted** (reloaded from JSON): `worldSystems`, `worldSystemsLoaded`
- Version: 4 (migration < 4 clears everything)
